# unstable-x86_64 configuration
#
# Build Solus packages using the unstable repository image.
# This is the default profile for the Solus build server and developers.
#
# Do not make changes to this file. solbuild is implemented in a stateless
# fashion, and will load files in a layered mechanism. If you wish to edit
# this profile, copy to /etc/solbuild/.
#
# It is generally advisable to create a *new* profile name in /etc, because
# we will load /etc/ before /usr/share. Thus, profiles with the same name
# in /etc/ are loaded *first* and will override this profile.
#
# Of course, if that's what you intended to do, then by all means, do so.

# Remove just a single repo from the base image

# If you have a local repo providing packages that exist in the main
# repository already, you should remove the repo, and re-add it *after*
# your local repository:
# remove_repos = ['Solus']
# add_repos = ['Local','Solus']

# Example of adding a remote repo
# [repo.Solus]
# uri = "https://mirrors.rit.edu/solus/packages/unstable/eopkg-index.xml.xz"

# Add a local repository by bind mounting it into chroot on each build
# [repo.Local]
# uri = "/var/lib/myrepo"
# local = true

# A local repo with automatic indexing
# [repo.LocalIndexed]
# uri = "/var/lib/myOtherRepo"
# local = true
# autoindex = true
